Introduction: In the Structural Engineering Research Lab, I assisted with an experiment comparing the compressive strength of concrete mixed and cured with saltwater versus freshwater. The project aimed to evaluate how different curing methods affect concrete strength. My task was to mix concrete using both types of water, pour it into 4”-8” cylinders, and incorporate reinforcements like steel mesh and glass fibers to test their impact on strength. I also operated a 300 Kip compression testing machine to measure compressive strength at 7, 14, and 28 days, and performed split tests to assess horizontal compression strength. In addition, I ensured proper laboratory safety protocols were followed, managed the project’s timeline, and adapted to challenges such as using a mechanical mixer due to material procurement delays. To complete my tasks, I utilized Microsoft Excel to organize and analyze data, tracking changes in concrete strength over time. I also gained introductory experience with MATLAB for data analysis and presented the findings through a research report and presentation board. My actions helped ensure accurate data collection and analysis, contributing to the project’s success. As a result, I developed practical laboratory skills, reinforced my understanding of concrete material testing, and enhanced my ability to manage research tasks while adhering to safety guidelines.
