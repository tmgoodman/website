Introduction: I was selected as a Research Assistant for the SDSU Research Foundation in both the Structural Engineering Lab and the Coastal Engineering Lab. In the Structural Engineering Lab, I worked under Professor Farone—who also taught my Statics and Dynamics courses—conducting experiments to test the compressive strength of concrete made with saltwater versus freshwater. In the Coastal Engineering Lab, I worked with Professor Sepúlveda, who was also my instructor for Hydraulics and Coastal Engineering, to run simulations analyzing the effects of climate change on tsunami and flood risk. These experiences deepened my technical skills and expanded my understanding of real-world environmental challenges.

# Structural Engineering Lab

# Background
In the Structural Engineering Research Lab, I assisted with an experiment comparing the compressive strength of concrete mixed and cured with saltwater versus freshwater. The project aimed to evaluate how different curing methods affect concrete strength. My task was to mix concrete using both types of water, pour it into 4”-8” cylinders, and incorporate reinforcements like steel mesh and glass fibers to test their impact on strength. I also operated a 300 Kip compression testing machine to measure compressive strength at 7, 14, and 28 days, and performed split tests to assess horizontal compression strength. In addition, I ensured proper laboratory safety protocols were followed, managed the project’s timeline, and adapted to challenges such as using a mechanical mixer due to material procurement delays. To complete my tasks, I utilized Microsoft Excel to organize and analyze data, tracking changes in concrete strength over time. I also gained introductory experience with MATLAB for data analysis and presented the findings through a research report and presentation board. My actions helped ensure accurate data collection and analysis, contributing to the project’s success. As a result, I developed practical laboratory skills, reinforced my understanding of concrete material testing, and enhanced my ability to manage research tasks while adhering to safety guidelines. 

# Coastal Engineering Lab

# Background
As a Research Assistant in the Coastal Engineering Lab, I contributed to projects focused on the study and simulation of tsunami generation and impact. Our research centered around evaluating advanced models for tsunamis generated by earthquakes, using tools such as the COMCOT tsunami model. I utilized remote sensing data and MATLAB to simulate historical tsunami events across various global regions and assess their potential future impact in the context of climate change. This work strengthened my technical skills in MATLAB and expanded my understanding of coastal hazard modeling and risk assessment. I continued developing my expertise in this field through Professor Sepúlveda’s Introduction to Coastal Engineering course, where we explored the underlying mathematics and theoretical frameworks that support coastal engineering practices. The course covered topics ranging from linear wave theory and extreme value analysis to the conceptual design of coastal structures, allowing me to deepen my understanding of the physical and computational aspects of marine environments.
