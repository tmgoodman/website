 The South Coast Water Desalination Project is located in Dana Point, California between Highway 1 and San Juan Creek. Marine groundwater will be sourced from slant wells located on the beach west of the site, ensuring a steady flow of water for treatment. The pretreatment system is specifically engineered to eliminate iron and manganese from seawater prior to the Reverse Osmosis process. By removing these impurities, the system ensures optimal performance, as iron and manganese can contribute to membrane scaling and fouling. If left untreated, these elements can accumulate on the membranes, resulting in decreased efficiency, higher maintenance costs, and a shorter membrane lifespan. By addressing these issues, the pretreatment system helps sustain peak performance and prolong the operational life of the desalination plant. 
 
 Given the high concentrations of manganese and iron at the source of the slant wells, the pretreatment system is essential for removing these metals before the RO process. Iron and manganese removal is typically achieved through chemical treatments that oxidize and filter out the impurities. The acceptable level of iron in drinking water is 0.1 mg/L, and for manganese, it is 0.05 mg/L. These are not health-based limits, but rather secondary standards designed to minimize aesthetic concerns such as undesirable taste, color, and staining. However, high levels of iron and manganese can cause membrane fouling, where the metals precipitate onto the reverse osmosis membranes. This results in a layer of scale or fouling on the membrane surface, reducing efficiency, shortening lifespan, and increasing maintenance costs. The marine groundwater contains a high concentration of iron and manganese, which must be removed before the RO process to prevent membrane fouling. Over time, if the levels of manganese and iron decrease, the plant may be able to process the water without the need for pretreatment.

The project takes into account the water chemistry, system sizing, and the required chemical treatment processes to ensure optimal performance and efficiency. This comprehensive approach will support a sustainable, long-term water supply for the area, while also serving as an emergency water source in the event that hazards disrupt or reduce the normally imported water supplies to the service area.

# South Coast Water Desalination Pretreatment Project

# Background
The South Coast Water Desalination Project is located in Dana Point, California between Highway 1 and San Juan Creek. Marine groundwater will be sourced from slant wells located on the beach west of the site, ensuring a steady flow of water for treatment. The pretreatment system is specifically engineered to eliminate iron and manganese from seawater prior to the Reverse Osmosis process. By removing these impurities, the system ensures optimal performance, as iron and manganese can contribute to membrane scaling and fouling. If left untreated, these elements can accumulate on the membranes, resulting in decreased efficiency, higher maintenance costs, and a shorter membrane lifespan. By addressing these issues, the pretreatment system helps sustain peak performance and prolong the operational life of the desalination plant.

Given the high concentrations of manganese and iron at the source of the slant wells, the pretreatment system is essential for removing these metals before the RO process. Iron and manganese removal is typically achieved through chemical treatments that oxidize and filter out the impurities. The acceptable level of iron in drinking water is 0.1 mg/L, and for manganese, it is 0.05 mg/L. These are not health-based limits, but rather secondary standards designed to minimize aesthetic concerns such as undesirable taste, color, and staining. However, high levels of iron and manganese can cause membrane fouling, where the metals precipitate onto the reverse osmosis membranes. This results in a layer of scale or fouling on the membrane surface, reducing efficiency, shortening lifespan, and increasing maintenance costs. The marine groundwater contains a high concentration of iron and manganese, which must be removed before the RO process to prevent membrane fouling. Over time, if the levels of manganese and iron decrease, the plant may be able to process the water without the need for pretreatment.
The treatment facility will be built on a 30-acre site, initially capable of treating 5 million gallons per day (MGD) of seawater, with the potential for future expansion to handle up to 15 MGD.

# Purpose and Objective
The South Coast Water Desalination Project aims to design an effective pre-treatment process for the new desalination plant. The primary focus of this pre-treatment system is to efficiently remove iron and manganese from seawater before it enters the Reverse Osmosis stage, therefore preventing membrane fouling and ensuring optimal performance of the desalination process. The pre-treatment system will remove iron and manganese to concentrations that meet drinking water standards and will not cause membrane fouling during the RO process. Our team will provide a comprehensive construction plan for the treatment system and associated facilities, including the design of chemical treatment processes, an environmental impact plan, and the overall site layout of the plant. Emphasis will be placed on risk management, sustainability, and ensuring compatibility with the larger desalination process. The South Coast Water desalination plant will provide a reliable local source of drinking water, which is essential for Southern California.

# Findings
## Chemical Treatment
Salt-Free Solutions conducted a thorough analysis to determine the most effective method for removing iron and manganese from the marine groundwater at the South Coast Water Desalination Plant. Salt-Free Solutions focused on a two-stage process for removing iron and manganese from the water. The first stage, oxidation, involves converting soluble iron and manganese into insoluble precipitates. The second stage, filtration, removes these precipitates from the water. The following treatment processes were considered:
Phosphate Treatment: Phosphate can delay the precipitation of iron and manganese but is effective for only low concentrations of these metals. Given the high levels of iron and manganese at the site, phosphate treatment was deemed ineffective.
Chlorine Oxidizing Agent: Chlorine can oxidize iron and manganese, but it is less effective for high manganese levels because it requires a high pH for proper oxidation. Chlorine can also form harmful byproducts, such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, when reacting with natural organic matter. Therefore, chlorine was eliminated as a treatment option due to these risks.
Potassium Permanganate Oxidizing Agent: Potassium permanganate was chosen as the optimal oxidizing agent. It effectively oxidizes both iron and manganese at the required pH, ensuring the complete removal of these metals.
Greensand Filtration: Greensand is a filter coated with manganese oxide, which was selected for its reliability in removing the precipitated iron and manganese. It acts as a secondary oxidant when needed and regenerates the filter media if excess potassium permanganate is used.
Salt-Free Solutions determined that the most effective treatment approach would be a combined method of potassium permanganate oxidation and greensand filtration for the efficient removal of iron and manganese from the water.
## Construction Plan
The proposed construction site is located in Dana Point, bordered by Highway 1 to the south, a railroad to the east, an existing road to the north, and San Juan Creek to the west. The treatment facility, which includes pretreatment, reverse osmosis, post-treatment, and related elements, will be located on a 30-acre, flat, cleared site, free of below-grade obstructions. The site has no existing utilities, except for a pump station at the northeast corner. Initial construction will focus on grading and improving the existing road along the western edge, with access restricted to the northern entrance via Stonehill Drive. The road will be extended to circle the full perimeter of the site in order to facilitate deliveries of construction materials during the construction phase, and deliveries of chemicals after commissioning. The desalination pretreatment facility will connect to an offshore well system and integrate with the existing pump building. The site can initially accommodate a plant capacity of 5 million gallons per day, with plans for future expansion to 15 MGD.
## Environmental Impact Study
The findings of the Environmental Impact Report highlight critical factors related to compliance, human health, ecology, infrastructure, and economic considerations in desalination pretreatment. Compliance with federal and state regulations, including the Clean Water Act and the California Coastal Commission, is essential to ensure safe operations. Health risks are associated with the use of potassium permanganate in oxidation and filtration processes, which may expose workers to hazardous contaminants, dust, and microbial growth. Environmental impacts include potential toxicity to aquatic life, soil contamination, and challenges in managing waste such as spent media, sludge, and filter cartridges. Economic impacts involve the costs of filtration systems, desalination plant operations, and potential effects on local tourism. Mitigation strategies aim to mitigate risks by implementing safety protocols, infrastructure maintenance, and regular monitoring. While desalination provides water security, it is important to balance health, environmental, and economic considerations to ensure sustainable and safe practices.

# Recommendations
## Chemical Treatment
Salt-Free Solutions recommends an oxidation filtration process using potassium permanganate and greensand filtration to effectively remove iron and manganese from marine groundwater before the reverse osmosis process. We have outlined the chemical composition of the water and its contaminants, and based on our analysis, the required dosage of potassium permanganate is 26 mg/L.
To produce 5 million gallons per day (MGD) of treated water, we will need to use 984.21 kg/day of potassium permanganate. For a plant of this size, we will require at least two operating pumps for chemical feed, with one on standby. Each pump will have a capacity of 81.15 gallons per day (GPD). After treatment, the water will pass through multimedia pressure filtration to remove the iron and manganese. We have also accounted for backwashing during the filtration process. The cartridge filters used for backwashing should be replaced every 3 to 6 months. We have included sizing details for the chemical storage facility, which should have a total volume of 22 cubic meters. All calculations and further details can be found in Appendix D.

## Construction Plan
The construction plan provided by Salt-Free Solutions aims to:
Ensure Safe Access: Given the restricted access to the site, implement clear signage and robust traffic management plans to maintain controlled entry points, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring smooth traffic flow for deliveries, equipment, and workforce.
Protect Existing Infrastructure: Given the need to protect the pump building and the offshore well system, establish physical barriers to ensure these structures remain unharmed during construction. Constant monitoring and regular assessments should be scheduled.
Optimize Site Layout: Given the need for a large laydown area, plan its layout carefully to optimize material storage and handling. Ensure that this area is large enough to accommodate ongoing shipments of manufactured components as construction progresses, minimizing delays.
Monitor Safety: Since construction will involve heavy vehicles and large equipment, prioritize safety measures, especially around the laydown area and roadways. Implement strict safety protocols and regularly train the workforce on site-specific hazards. 

## Environmental Impact Study
Salt-Free Solutions’ recommendations focus on ensuring compliance with federal and state regulations, managing health and environmental risks from oxidation chemicals, and maintaining infrastructure to avoid material degradation. Our goals are to minimize emissions, address waste management, and implement safety protocols. Economic considerations involve managing desalination costs and mitigating potential tourism decline. Additionally, efforts should be made to enhance water quality, promote ecosystem sustainability, and ensure safe disposal practices for waste materials. Overall, we plan to balance environmental, health, and operational safety while maximizing the benefits of desalination.

# CONCLUSION							
In conclusion, the South Coast Water Desalination Plant is a pivotal project designed to address the growing water needs of Dana Point and its surrounding areas by providing a reliable, sustainable, and independent water source. The successful implementation of a pre-treatment system to remove iron and manganese is crucial to the plant's efficiency, ensuring that the reverse osmosis process operates without issues such as membrane fouling. The recommended chemical treatment process, utilizing potassium permanganate and greensand filtration will effectively address the high concentrations of these metals, providing clean, safe drinking water for the region.
