# Tegan Goodman
I am an Environmental Engineering student at San Diego State University with a passion for advancing sustainability through innovative resource management and built environment solutions. My academic background is complemented by hands-on experience in GIS analysis, environmental modeling, and civil engineering research, including tsunami simulations and sustainable concrete testing.

I bring proficiency in AutoCAD, MATLAB, and GIS, and have developed strong leadership, technical writing, and collaborative skills through lab research, professional organizations, and project management. As a project lead on my senior capstone, I directed the design of a desalination pretreatment system; an experience that sharpened my skills in environmental planning, scheduling, and stakeholder communication.

My global perspective, shaped by international study and volunteer work, reinforces my commitment to sustainability, public service, and lifelong learning. I am eager to contribute to interdisciplinary teams tackling water quality, infrastructure, and environmental resilience challenges.
