Introduction: I'm an Environmental Engineering student at San Diego State University with a solid foundation in sustainability, infrastructure, and environmental systems. I have hands-on experience with GIS, MATLAB, AutoCAD, and laboratory research, which I've applied in real-world settings—from interning with the City of San Diego on waste management initiatives to conducting climate-related hazard simulations in the Coastal Engineering Lab. Studying abroad in Spain and volunteering in Peru have shaped my global outlook, and I'm active in professional organizations like the Society of Women Engineers and AWWA to continue learning and connecting. I'm passionate about using innovative, data-driven solutions to build more resilient and sustainable communities.

● Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering

Universidad Carlos III de Madrid | Madrid, Spain				           	       January - May 2023                                               
● Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering

# Experience
GIS Management Intern | City of San Diego | Environmental Services Department 	July 2024 - Present                                         
●	Conducted spatial analysis with ArcGIS and QGIS to optimize waste management routes.                                        
●	Completed technical analysis and contributed to a federal grant proposal (SWIFR) by utilizing the EPA Waste Reduction Model.  Conducted calculations and collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop and support the proposal.                                      
●	Observed the significant city transition due to Measure B, an amendment to San Diegos People’s Ordinance allowing the city to charge for waste services. I contributed by attending planning meetings, researching code amendments, fiscal impacts, business contracts, and conducting GIS analysis to assess the spatial and operational impacts of rerouting collection services.                                     
●	Attended the ESRI GIS User Conference, where I networked and participated in various informational seminars. Actively engaged in a working group to purpose a new Standard Occupational Classification.               

Student Research Assistant | Coastal Engineering Lab | San Diego State University         May 2024 - Aug. 2024                                  
●	Utilized MATLAB and remote sensing data to perform tsunami simulations, measuring the strength of past tsunamis in various global regions and comparing them to projected future hazards related to climate change.                     
                                            
Student Research Assistant | Structural Engineering Lab | San Diego State University    May 2022 – Sep. 2022                                        
●	Conducted experiments comparing the compressive and tensile strength of concrete mixed and cured with saltwater versus freshwater.          
●	Analyzed data comparing the concrete strength of saltwater versus freshwater mixtures and how it changed over time.
